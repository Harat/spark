spark
=====

Spark is a lightweight responsive web design framework with multiple styles.

<h2>Choices</h2>
The framework comes prebuilt with several color themes that are interchangeable and a couple of styles. 

<h2>Nonintrusive</h2>
Spark is what we like to call nonintrusive. When you include the css/js files in the head of your HTML file, by default with no extra classes it styles only the bare necessities like font families/weights/sizes/colors, resets etc. While it may require slightly more markup than other frameworks to use theme elements, it's much easier to customize elements with the default all-in Spark rather than having to call big long selector lists to override. And that's why we started it.

<h2>Simplicity</h2>
The whole basis of Spark is to keep things simple. Simple to use and simple to customize.

<h2>The Project</h2>
The project lives here and at http://www.codewithspark.com where you can find all the documentation on how to use it.

<h2>Planned</h2>
Currently planned is to use the custom.less file to allow you to create your own colors for the themes. A page on the website will allow you to enter colors and automatically generate LESS for you to paste into your custom.less file, allowing you to use your own theme colors almost instantly.
