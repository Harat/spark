Releases and Update Notes

Spark 1.0.1 - Initial Release
Initial release of Spark. Skipped releasing 1.0.0 for some important bugs found after packaging.
UPGRADE NOTES: none

Spark 1.1.0 - Minor Update and Bug fixes
Fixed a few critical bugs, updated to FontAwesome 4.1, added copy colors
Gave it the wrong version number in the copyright statement for some reason, which is always useful.
UPGRADE NOTES: none

Spark 2.0.0
Huge rewrite. New and improved and worthy of a major version number.
UPGRADE NOTES:
.hero-edgeless has become .hero and old .hero has been deprecated.
.hero must be on a .container.
To use .limit on the.hero, you should add a .row and .col(s) inside.
Headings are now font-weight 200 by default. Adjust weight with .super-skinny, .heavy and .heavier.
The .skinny-headings global body class has been deprecated (since they are now the default).
Colors have been tweaked to be more neutral, less saturated and now include cosmic.
.note deprecated.
Alerts are now flat so .alert-flat has been deprecated.
The navigation bar markup structure has been redesigned. It's fairly similar but check the docs on the website for a full description.
Nav bar .name is now .brand.
An ID of primary-nav is no longer necessary on nav .bar (although an ID  is obviously still recommended).
For compatibility, all form types now use .input-containers, including .form-inline and for buttons (submit etc.).
Classes now go on the .input-container, rather than the input.
Visually different input elements (checkbox, radio, select, file, textarea) require an additional class on their .input-container. That class is the type of input, for example .checkbox or .radio. For obvious reasons, textareas do not work with .form-inline.
